    "### Load and Filter Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the code processes and filters datasets based on selected features:\n",
    "1. **Setup**:\n",
    "   - **Output Directory**: Creates the output directory if it does not already exist.\n",
    "   - **Essential Columns**: List of essential columns to keep in all datasets (`\"Age\"`, `\"Sex\"`, `\"APOE4\"`, `\"Diagnosis\"`, `\"ID_1\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Each Directory and Dataset**:\n",
    "   - **Directory and Dataset Pairing**: Matches each directory with its corresponding dataset.\n",
    "   - **Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "     - **Load RFE Results**: Reads `rfe_results.csv` to get the list of selected features.\n",
    "     - **Extract Features**: Assumes the `Feature` column in `rfe_results.csv` lists the features to keep.\n",
    "   - **Dataset Loading**:\n",
    "     - **Ensure 'ID_1'**: Moves the `'ID_1'` column to the first position in the dataset.\n",
    "     - **Filter Columns**: Combines essential columns with selected features, ensuring `'ID_1'` is first.\n",
    "   - **Save Filtered Dataset**: Saves the filtered dataset to the specified output directory with the condition's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results**:\n",
    "   - **Return**: Provides a dictionary with the status of dataset processing and saving."
